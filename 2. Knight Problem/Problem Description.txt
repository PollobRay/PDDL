Given a four knights problem in a 3x3 grid board, where the goal is to get each knight into the opposite corner. (A knight can move to an unoccupied space according to an L-shape movement: it must move two spaces horizontally and one vertically, or two spaces vertically and one horizontally.) Describe the problem in classical planning representation by writing a domain file and a problem file in PDDL.

Initial positions of the four knights 
1 _ 2
- - -
3 _ 4

Goal positions of those four knights:
